# Benchmarking Analysis

This project involves the use of microsoft excel to carry out a benchmarking study on three basketball teams. In this case scenario, my dad, uncle, and my aunt support each of these teams and I am to present an analysis where I compared the performance of the three basketball teams. The full case scenario can be found [here]()
# What is Benchmarking?
Benchmarking means making meaningful comparison to others, and identifying opportunities to improve. It is used to identify "best in class", identify the gap, and close the gap. In business, it is used to measure the performance of a company's products, services or processes against those of another business considered to be the best in the industry.
